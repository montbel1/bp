  async calculateTax(taxData: TaxFormData): Promise<TaxCalculation> {
    // 1. Basic calculation with our engine
    const basicCalculation = this.basicEngine.calculate(taxData);
    
    // 2. Validate with external APIs
    const taxActResult = await this.taxActAPI.validate(basicCalculation);
    const taxJarResult = await this.taxJarAPI.validate(basicCalculation);
    
    // 3. Return comprehensive result
    return {
      ...basicCalculation,
      externalValidation: {
