# TaxPro API Integration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of Option 1 (External Tax Calculation API) for the TaxPro module, integrating with free external tax calculation services.

## Implemented Services

### 1. IRS Free File API Integration
- **Service**: `IRSTaxAPI` class in `src/lib/tax-calculation-service.ts`
- **Features**: 
  - Federal tax calculations using 2024 tax brackets
  - Real-time tax rate fetching
  - Fallback to basic calculations if API fails
- **Cost**: Free (with limitations)
- **Coverage**: Individual and business tax returns

### 2. TaxCloud API Integration (Free Tier)
- **Service**: `TaxCloudAPI` class in `src/lib/tax-calculation-service.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Sales tax calculations
  - State-specific tax rates
  - County-level tax calculations
- **Cost**: Free tier available
- **Coverage**: Sales tax, business tax calculations

### 3. Main Tax Calculation Service
- **Service**: `TaxCalculationService` class
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive tax calculations (federal + state + sales)
  - Deduction validation
  - Confidence scoring
  - Tax recommendations
  - Estimated tax calculations

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/taxpro/calculate
- **Purpose**: Calculate tax liability using external APIs
- **Input**: TaxFormData (income, deductions, filing status, state, etc.)
- **Output**: TaxCalculation with breakdown, confidence score, and recommendations
- **Integration**: Uses IRS API and TaxCloud API with fallback calculations

### GET /api/taxpro/calculate
- **Purpose**: Fetch current year tax rates
- **Output**: TaxRates with current year brackets
- **Integration**: Fetches from IRS API with fallback to hardcoded rates

## TypeScript Types

### Core Types (src/types/tax.ts)
```typescript
interface TaxFormData {
  income: number
  deductions: Deduction[]
  filingStatus: 'SINGLE' | 'MARRIED' | 'HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD' | 'QUALIFYING_WIDOW'
  state?: string
  salesAmount?: number
  taxYear: number
}

interface TaxCalculation {
  grossIncome: number
  adjustedGrossIncome: number
  taxableIncome: number
  taxOwed: number
  refund: number
  effectiveRate: number
  stateTax?: number
  salesTax?: number
  totalTax?: number
  breakdown: TaxBreakdown
  confidence?: number
  recommendations?: string[]
}
```

  deductions: [{ type: 'STANDARD_DEDUCTION', amount: 12950 }],
  filingStatus: 'SINGLE',
  state: 'CA',
  taxYear: 2024
}

const calculation = await taxCalculationService.calculateTax(taxData)
```

### Sales Tax Calculation
```typescript
const salesTax = await taxCloudAPI.calculateSalesTax(1000, 'CA', 'Los Angeles')
```
