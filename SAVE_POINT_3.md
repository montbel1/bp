## Technical Infrastructure

### Database Schema (Prisma)
- **User Management**: Proper user authentication and session handling
- **Tax Models**: `TaxForm`, `TaxDocument`, `TaxClient`, `TaxDeadline`
- **Flow Models**: `Job`, `Task`, `Client`
- **Bookkeeping Models**: `ChartAccount`, `Transaction`, `Category`, `Currency`, `BankAccount`, `BankTransaction`
- **Customer Models**: `Customer` with full profile management

### API Endpoints Implemented
- **TaxPro**: `/api/taxpro`, `/api/taxpro/forms/[id]`
- **Flow**: `/api/flow/jobs`
- **Bookkeeping**: `/api/accounts`, `/api/transactions`, `/api/categories`, `/api/settings/currencies`
- **Bank Reconciliation**: `/api/bank-accounts`, `/api/bank-accounts/[id]/transactions`
- **Client Management**: `/api/clients`, `/api/customers`
- **Database Setup**: `/api/setup-db` (temporary)

### UI Components
- **Navigation**: Updated with new module links
- **Forms**: Dynamic form generation based on data models
- **Tables**: Comprehensive data display with actions
- **Modals**: Confirmation dialogs and inline forms
- **Wizards**: Multi-step creation processes

## Current Status: Production-Ready Core
The application now has:
- ✅ Functional engine (core CRUD operations)
- ✅ Transmission (data flow and API integration)
- ✅ Fuel injection (inline creation system)
- ✅ Basic wiring (navigation and routing)
- ✅ Dashboard and management interfaces

## Next Phase: End-User Testing
The next step is comprehensive end-user testing simulation to identify:
- Missing functionality for real-world usage
- UX improvements needed
- Integration gaps between modules
- Production readiness assessment
